points A is (numbers (A x)) && (numbers (A y));

A + B is [A + B] when (points A) && (points B);
A + B x is (A x) + (B x) when (points A) && (points B);
A + B y is (A y) + (B y) when (points A) && (points B);


##A + B is [point ((A x) + (B x)) ((A y) + (B y))] when (points A) && (points B);

point X Y is [point X Y];
point X Y x is X;
point X Y y is Y;

my point 1 is point 5 10;
my point 2 is point 50 100;

my added is (my point 1) + (my point 2);
